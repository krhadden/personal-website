        <div class="about-bio">
            My passion lives where creativity and logic collide.  While pursuing various forms of artistic expression, thinking logically is at my core.  
            I earned a Bachelor of Science in Applied Mathematics from the University of Arkansas in 2018 and have since been working as a software engineer at BAE Systems, Inc in San Diego.  
            The process of creating new, intuitive designs to meet an abstract end goal is such a rewarding task- and it’s what I aim to do in my future.  
            I’m driven to design technologies that let humans interact with computers in novel ways to improve conventions effectively and creatively.
