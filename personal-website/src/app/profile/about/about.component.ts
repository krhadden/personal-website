I earned a B.S. in Applied Mathematics from the University of Arkansas in 2018 and have been working as a software engineer ever since. In San Diego at BAE Systems, Inc., I created web apps for satellites and crime investigations.  At Microsoft, I created DevOps monitors for system automations and I migrated Azure services to a Top Secret cloud environment.  For the last year at Swoop I've built several large features, including a messaging system, mesh visualizations, and CryptoAgility profile creation.  Iâ€™m driven to design technologies that let humans interact with computers in novel ways and to improve conventions effectively and creatively.";
